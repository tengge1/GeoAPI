# GeoAPI



GeoAPI project provides a common framework based on OGC/ISO standards to improve interoperability among .NET GIS projects. GeoAPI is used mostly as a base for [NTS](https://github.com/NetTopologySuite/NetTopologySuite/)

### Supported platforms

GeoAPI supports a wide range of .NET versions:

- net40-client

### Development & building

Because of the wide support of platforms, building GeoAPI can be a pain. Make sure you install all the targeting packs. We provided a few scripts for this in the root folder of this repo.
